1.1 About Majutsu
=================

Majutsu aims to bring the legendary workflow of Magit to the Jujutsu
(jj) version control system.  It is not merely a wrapper around the ‘jj’
CLI, but a deeply integrated Emacs environment that leverages Magit's
section management and transient menu systems.  Majutsu provides visual
tools for complex operations like rebasing, squashing, and conflict
resolution, making the power of Jujutsu accessible and intuitive.

   Originally started as a fork of ‘jj-mode.el’, Majutsu has been
heavily refactored and expanded to include a new template DSL,
asynchronous process handling, and a native Evil-mode integration.


File: majutsu.info,  Node: About Jujutsu,  Next: Acknowledgments,  Prev: About Majutsu,  Up: Introduction

1.2 About Jujutsu
=================

Jujutsu (jj) is a next-generation version control system that is both
simple and powerful.  It features a unique "working copy is a commit"
model (@), first-class support for mutable history, and robust conflict
management.  Unlike Git, jj does not have a staging area; instead,
changes in the working copy are automatically recorded into the current
revision.  This makes it an ideal companion for Emacs, where buffers are
often in a state of flux.

1.3 Acknowledgments
===================

Majutsu stands on the shoulders of giants.  We are grateful to:
   • The Jujutsu community for creating a revolutionary VCS.
   • The Magit authors and contributors for defining the gold standard
     of VCS interfaces.
   • Brandon Olivier for the initial codebase of ‘jj-mode.el’.

File: majutsu.info,  Node: Getting Started,  Next: Interface Concepts,  Prev: Installation,  Up: Top

3 Getting Started
*****************

To begin using Majutsu, navigate to a directory within a Jujutsu
repository and run ‘M-x majutsu’ (or its alias ‘majutsu-log’).

   If the directory is not a repository, Majutsu will offer to
initialize one using ‘jj git init’.  Once the log buffer opens, you will
see a graphical representation of your revision history, similar to
Magit's log but with Jujutsu's unique features like hidden and divergent
revisions clearly marked.

   Navigation is straightforward: use ‘n’ and ‘p’ to move between
revisions, and ‘RET’ to visit the revision at point.  Press ‘?’ at any
time to open the Dispatcher, which shows all available commands.

File: majutsu.info,  Node: Buffers and Modes,  Next: Sections,  Up: Interface Concepts

4.1 Buffers and Modes
=====================

Majutsu uses several specialized buffer types to provide a rich
interface.

* Menu:

* Log Buffer::
* Diff Buffer::
* Blob Buffer::
* Process Buffer::
* Message Buffer::


File: majutsu.info,  Node: Log Buffer,  Next: Diff Buffer,  Up: Buffers and Modes

4.1.1 Log Buffer
----------------

The primary interface for Majutsu.  It displays the revision graph,
working copy status, and active workspaces.  It uses ‘majutsu-log-mode’,
derived from ‘magit-section-mode’.


File: majutsu.info,  Node: Diff Buffer,  Next: Blob Buffer,  Prev: Log Buffer,  Up: Buffers and Modes

4.1.2 Diff Buffer
-----------------

Displays changes between revisions or within the working copy.  It
supports Magit-style hunk and file sections, word-level refinement, and
interactive patching.


File: majutsu.info,  Node: Blob Buffer,  Next: Process Buffer,  Prev: Diff Buffer,  Up: Buffers and Modes

4.1.3 Blob Buffer
-----------------

Allows viewing the contents of a file at a specific revision.  You can
navigate through the file's history using ‘n’ and ‘p’ within the blob
buffer.


File: majutsu.info,  Node: Process Buffer,  Next: Message Buffer,  Prev: Blob Buffer,  Up: Buffers and Modes

4.1.4 Process Buffer
--------------------

Shows the output of background ‘jj’ commands.  If a command fails, you
can press ‘$’ to inspect the error.


File: majutsu.info,  Node: Message Buffer,  Prev: Process Buffer,  Up: Buffers and Modes

4.1.5 Message Buffer
--------------------

Used for writing commit descriptions or other interactive input.  It
uses ‘with-editor’ to ensure seamless integration with the Emacs
environment.


File: majutsu.info,  Node: Sections,  Next: Transient Menus,  Prev: Buffers and Modes,  Up: Interface Concepts

4.2 Sections
============

Majutsu organizes information into collapsible sections.  You can use
‘TAB’ to toggle the visibility of a section (e.g., a revision's
description in the log, or a file in a diff).


File: majutsu.info,  Node: Transient Menus,  Next: Visual Selection System,  Prev: Sections,  Up: Interface Concepts

4.3 Transient Menus
===================

Commands in Majutsu are grouped into "transient" menus.  These popups
allow you to select options and flags before executing a command.  For
example, pressing ‘r’ opens the Rebase transient.


File: majutsu.info,  Node: Visual Selection System,  Next: Completion and Confirmation,  Prev: Transient Menus,  Up: Interface Concepts

4.4 Visual Selection System
===========================

For commands like Rebase or Squash, Majutsu uses a visual selection
system.  You can mark "source" and "destination" revisions directly in
the log buffer, and they will be highlighted with distinct colors until
the operation is executed or cleared.


File: majutsu.info,  Node: Completion and Confirmation,  Next: Running JJ,  Prev: Visual Selection System,  Up: Interface Concepts

4.5 Completion and Confirmation
===============================

Majutsu integrates with Emacs' completion system (like Vertico or Ivy)
for selecting bookmarks, remotes, and revsets.  Destructive operations
like ‘abandon’ or ‘undo’ will prompt for confirmation.


File: majutsu.info,  Node: Running JJ,  Prev: Completion and Confirmation,  Up: Interface Concepts

4.6 Running JJ
==============

Majutsu runs ‘jj’ commands asynchronously whenever possible to keep the
Emacs UI responsive.  Large log graphs or remote operations won't freeze
your editor.

File: majutsu.info,  Node: Revset Builder,  Prev: Log Options Transient,  Up: Log Buffer (1)

5.1.3 Revset Builder
--------------------

While you can type revsets manually, Majutsu's selection system allows
you to build them interactively.  Commands that require a revset will
often default to the revision at point or your current selection.

File: majutsu.info,  Node: How It Works,  Next: Diff Context Inheritance,  Up: Interactive Patching

6.12.1 How It Works
-------------------

Interactive selection is integrated into the Split (‘S’), Squash (‘s’),
and Restore (‘R’) transients.  When you open one of these transients
from a Diff buffer, a "Patch Selection" group appears with the following
commands:

Key   Command                             Description
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
‘H’   majutsu-interactive-toggle-hunk     Toggle selection of hunk at point
‘F’   majutsu-interactive-toggle-file     Toggle selection of all hunks in file
‘R’   majutsu-interactive-toggle-region   Toggle selection of active region
‘C’   majutsu-interactive-clear           Clear all patch selections


File: majutsu.info,  Node: Diff Context Inheritance,  Next: Visual Feedback,  Prev: How It Works,  Up: Interactive Patching

6.12.2 Diff Context Inheritance
-------------------------------

When opening Split, Squash, or Restore from a Diff buffer, the transient
automatically inherits the diff's context:
   • All three commands inherit ‘--revisions’ as their target revision
     (‘--revision’ for Split/Squash)
   • Restore additionally inherits ‘--from’ and ‘--to’ parameters,
     allowing selective restoration between arbitrary revisions

   This means you can:
  1. View a diff with specific ‘--from’ / ‘--to’ revisions
  2. Open the Restore transient
  3. Select specific hunks to restore
  4. The restore will apply only to those hunks, using the diff's
     revision context


File: majutsu.info,  Node: Visual Feedback,  Next: Selection Semantics,  Prev: Diff Context Inheritance,  Up: Interactive Patching

6.12.3 Visual Feedback
----------------------

Selected hunks are highlighted with ‘majutsu-interactive-selected-hunk’
face (green background by default).  Selected regions within hunks use
‘majutsu-interactive-selected-region’ face (purple background).


File: majutsu.info,  Node: Selection Semantics,  Next: Technical Implementation,  Prev: Visual Feedback,  Up: Interactive Patching

6.12.4 Selection Semantics
--------------------------

The meaning of "selected" differs by operation:

  1. Split and Squash

     For Split and Squash, *selected content is what gets moved*:
        • *Split*: Selected hunks/regions go into the *first* commit;
          unselected content stays in the second commit.
        • *Squash*: Selected hunks/regions get *squashed into the
          parent*; unselected content remains in the current revision.

     Example: You have a revision with changes to files A, B, and C.
     You want to squash only the changes to file A into the parent:
       1. Open the diff for the revision (‘D’)
       2. Open Squash transient (‘s’)
       3. Press ‘F’ on file A to select all its hunks
       4. Execute squash - file A's changes go to parent, B and C stay

  2. Restore

     For Restore, selected content is what gets *restored* (undone):
        • Selected hunks/regions are reverted to their state in the
          source revision
        • Unselected content is left unchanged


File: majutsu.info,  Node: Technical Implementation,  Next: Edge Cases,  Prev: Selection Semantics,  Up: Interactive Patching

6.12.5 Technical Implementation
-------------------------------

Majutsu uses a custom merge tool to apply partial patches.  When you
execute an operation with selections:

  1. *Patch Generation*: Majutsu generates a unified diff patch
     containing only the selected hunks/regions.

  2. *Tool Invocation*: Jujutsu's ‘-i --tool’ mechanism is used with a
     custom ‘majutsu-applypatch’ tool.

  3. *Patch Application*:
        • For *Split/Squash*: The tool resets ‘$right’ (current state)
          to ‘$left’ (parent state), then applies the patch forward.
          This results in ‘$right’ containing only the selected changes.
        • For *Restore*: The tool applies the patch directly to
          ‘$right’.

   This approach avoids the complexity of reverse patch application
(‘git apply -R’), which has edge cases with new files, deleted files,
and content starting with ‘+’ or ‘-’.

6.12.6 Edge Cases
-----------------

Interactive patching supports all file operation types:

  1. New Files

     When splitting or squashing a new file:
        • If you select the entire file, it goes to the first commit /
          gets squashed
        • If you select only part of the file, only those lines go; the
          rest stays
        • Partial selection of new files works correctly because the
          patch is applied forward after resetting to parent state

  2. Deleted Files

     *Note: Interactive selection for deleted files is currently
     limited.*

     When splitting or squashing a file deletion:
        • Selecting the *entire* deletion works correctly - the file
          gets deleted in the first commit / parent
        • *Partial selection of deleted files is not yet supported* -
          you must select all lines or none

     This limitation exists because git's patch format requires ‘deleted
     file mode’ patches to remove the entire file contents.  Partial
     deletion would require converting to a regular modification patch,
     which has edge cases with context matching.

  3. Renamed/Copied Files

     Renamed and copied files are handled correctly:
        • The rename/copy metadata is preserved in the patch
        • You can select specific hunks within renamed files just like
          regular modifications

File: majutsu.info,  Node: Overview,  Next: Why Use the DSL?,  Up: Template DSL

12.1 Overview
=============

Majutsu includes a domain-specific language (DSL) for building Jujutsu
templates in Emacs Lisp.  The main entry point is ‘majutsu-tpl’, which
compiles a vector-based DSL form into a jj template string.


File: majutsu.info,  Node: Why Use the DSL?,  Next: Basic Syntax,  Prev: Overview,  Up: Template DSL

12.2 Why Use the DSL?
=====================

The DSL provides several advantages over writing raw template strings:

   • *Compile-time validation*: Syntax errors are caught during
     byte-compilation rather than at runtime when jj executes the
     template.
   • *Automatic escaping*: String literals are properly escaped (quotes,
     backslashes, control characters) without manual intervention.
   • *Elisp integration*: Embed Elisp expressions that evaluate at
     compile time, enabling dynamic template generation based on
     configuration or context.
   • *Composability*: Define reusable template functions with
     ‘majutsu-template-defun’ that expand inline, avoiding runtime
     overhead.
   • *Type awareness*: The DSL understands jj's type system, enabling
     self-type context for cleaner keyword syntax (‘[:description]’
     instead of ‘[:method [:raw "self"] :description]’).
   • *Readability*: Vector-based syntax with keywords is more readable
     than deeply nested string concatenation.

   Example comparison:
     ;; Raw string (error-prone, hard to read)
     "if(self.root(), \"(root)\", self.commit_id().short())"

     ;; DSL (validated, composable, readable)
     (majutsu-tpl [:if [:raw "self.root()"] "(root)" [:method [:raw "self"] :commit_id :short]])

12.3 Basic Syntax
=================

* Menu:

* Vectors and Concatenation::
* String Literals::
* Raw Injection::
* Booleans and Numbers::


File: majutsu.info,  Node: Vectors and Concatenation,  Next: String Literals,  Up: Basic Syntax

12.3.1 Vectors and Concatenation
--------------------------------

Vectors without a leading keyword are implicitly concatenated:
     (majutsu-tpl ["A" "B"])           ; => concat("A", "B")
     (majutsu-tpl [:concat "A" "B"])   ; => concat("A", "B")  (explicit)

   Bare strings inside vectors are automatically treated as string
literals (‘:str’).


File: majutsu.info,  Node: String Literals,  Next: Raw Injection,  Prev: Vectors and Concatenation,  Up: Basic Syntax

12.3.2 String Literals
----------------------

Use ‘:str’ for explicit string literals with proper escaping:
     (majutsu-tpl [:str "Hello \"World\""])  ; => "Hello \"World\""


File: majutsu.info,  Node: Raw Injection,  Next: Booleans and Numbers,  Prev: String Literals,  Up: Basic Syntax

12.3.3 Raw Injection
--------------------

Use ‘:raw’ to inject template code directly without escaping:
     (majutsu-tpl [:raw "self.commit_id().short()"])  ; => self.commit_id().short()

   Symbols passed to ‘:call’ are treated as raw identifiers:
     (majutsu-tpl [:call 'coalesce [:str ""] [:str "X"]])  ; => coalesce("", "X")


File: majutsu.info,  Node: Booleans and Numbers,  Prev: Raw Injection,  Up: Basic Syntax

12.3.4 Booleans and Numbers
---------------------------

Elisp ‘t’ and ‘nil’ map to ‘true’ and ‘false’.  Numbers pass through
directly:
     (majutsu-tpl [:if t "yes" "no"])      ; => if(true, "yes", "no")
     (majutsu-tpl [:call 'pad_end 8 "x"])  ; => pad_end(8, "x")

* Explicit Method Chaining::
* Self-Type Context::


File: majutsu.info,  Node: Explicit Method Chaining,  Next: Self-Type Context,  Up: Method Calls

12.4.1 Explicit Method Chaining
-------------------------------

Use ‘:method’ to call methods on objects.  Methods can be chained:
     (majutsu-tpl [:method [:raw "self" :Commit] :commit_id])
     ; => self.commit_id()

     (majutsu-tpl [:method [:raw "self" :Commit] :parents :len])
     ; => self.parents().len()

     (majutsu-tpl [:method [:raw "self" :Commit] :diff "src"])
     ; => self.diff("src")


File: majutsu.info,  Node: Self-Type Context,  Prev: Explicit Method Chaining,  Up: Method Calls

12.4.2 Self-Type Context
------------------------

When a self-type is provided, bare keywords become method calls on
‘self’:
     (majutsu-tpl [:description] 'Commit)      ; => self.description()
     (majutsu-tpl [:parents :len] 'Commit)     ; => self.parents().len()


File: majutsu.info,  Node: List Operations,  Next: Operators,  Prev: Method Calls,  Up: Template DSL

12.5 List Operations
====================

List methods (‘map’, ‘filter’, ‘any’, ‘all’) use a special syntax with a
binding variable:
     (majutsu-tpl [:map [:raw "self.bookmarks()"] b [:raw "b.name()"]])
     ; => self.bookmarks().map(|b| b.name())

     (majutsu-tpl [:map-join [:str ", "] [:raw "self.parents()"] p [:raw "p.commit_id()"]])
     ; => self.parents().map(|p| p.commit_id()).join(", ")

     (majutsu-tpl [:filter [:raw "parents"] c [:raw "c.mine()"]])
     ; => parents.filter(|c| c.mine())

     (majutsu-tpl [:any [:raw "parents"] c [:raw "c.conflict()"]])
     ; => parents.any(|c| c.conflict())


File: majutsu.info,  Node: Operators,  Next: Conditional and Control Flow,  Prev: List Operations,  Up: Template DSL

12.6 Operators
==============

Arithmetic and logical operators are supported:
     (majutsu-tpl [:+ 1 2])              ; => (1 + 2)
     (majutsu-tpl [:and [:> 3 1] [:<= 2 2]])  ; => ((3 > 1) && (2 <= 2))
     (majutsu-tpl [:not t])              ; => (!true)
     (majutsu-tpl [:++ "L" "R"])         ; => ("L" ++ "R")  (string concat operator)

12.7 Conditional and Control Flow
=================================

     (majutsu-tpl [:if [:raw "self.root()"] "(root)" [:raw "self.commit_id()"]])
     ; => if(self.root(), "(root)", self.commit_id())

     (majutsu-tpl [:separate " " [:label "a" "A"] [:label "b" "B"]])
     ; => separate(" ", label("a", "A"), label("b", "B"))


File: majutsu.info,  Node: Elisp Embedding,  Next: Defining Custom Functions,  Prev: Conditional and Control Flow,  Up: Template DSL

12.8 Elisp Embedding
====================

Elisp expressions are evaluated at compile time:
     (majutsu-tpl [:raw (if t "foo" "bar")])  ; => foo
     (majutsu-tpl [:concat (if (> 2 1) [:str "T"] [:str "F"]) [:str "!"]])
     ; => concat("T", "!")


File: majutsu.info,  Node: Defining Custom Functions,  Next: Type System,  Prev: Elisp Embedding,  Up: Template DSL

12.9 Defining Custom Functions
==============================

Use ‘majutsu-template-defun’ to define reusable template functions:
     (majutsu-template-defun my-helper ((label Template) (value Template :optional t))
       (:returns Template)
       `[:concat ,label [:str ": "] ,(or value [:str ""])])

     (majutsu-tpl [:my-helper [:str "ID"] [:str "VAL"]])
     ; => concat("ID", ": ", "VAL")


File: majutsu.info,  Node: Type System,  Next: Supported Commands,  Prev: Defining Custom Functions,  Up: Template DSL

12.10 Type System
=================

The DSL supports Jujutsu's type system: ‘String’, ‘Boolean’, ‘Integer’,
‘Template’, ‘Commit’, ‘Signature’, ‘Timestamp’, ‘List’, ‘Option’, and
more.  Type annotations can be added to ‘:raw’ nodes:
     [:raw "self" :Commit]  ; Declares the raw value has type Commit
